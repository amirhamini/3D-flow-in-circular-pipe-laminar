A general methodological/scientific approach to develop a CFD simulation case via ANSYS FLUENT for laminar flow in a circular pipe is explained and discussed here.

The four major steps to develop a CFD simulation case for any fluid mechanics consists the following four steps:

1. **CFD Problem's Physics & Theory**
2. **CFD Domain's Creation & Discretization**
3. **CFD Simulation Case Setup**
4. **CFD Results Post-Process**

This wiki includes the explanation of the above-mentioned steps for the problem of Laminar Flow in a Circular Pipe.
